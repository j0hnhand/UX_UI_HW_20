                    The Gangstas to Growers website is intended to be a portal 
                    allowing community-invested donors to feel connected to the 
                    local cause and make contributions. We have observed through 
                    surveys and interviews that users like Latonya Johnson want 
                    to see more information about the organization, transparency 
                    and benefits of the program. These shortcomings are causing 
                    a lack of donations and purchases, as well as a lack of
